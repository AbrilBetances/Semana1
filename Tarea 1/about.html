<h1>Nice movies to look at</h1>
<p>This website is simply a selection of films that I think we should all see as designers, photographers and illustrators. In my opinion we do not have to be film experts to know when a movie is good or not, we just have to enjoy it. Here I have a short list of the films that have visually caught my attention, I did not focus on the plot or the shots (I am not an expert). I focused on the colors and how nice these movies are to simply look at them. As a designer I know how important a good color palette is for a design, but I had never noticed that for a film it is almost the same. So this list is for you, for those who love color and enjoy when there is a good selection.</p>
